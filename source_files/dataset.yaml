# dataset.yaml
#
# This file describes the custom dataset for training the YOLOv8 model.
# It tells the training script where to find the images and labels, and defines the classes.

# Path to the directory containing training images.
# The script will look for a corresponding 'labels' folder at the same level.
# Example: ../datasets/osu/images/train/
train: ../datasets/osu/images/train

# Path to the directory containing validation images.
# Example: ../datasets/osu/images/val/
val: ../datasets/osu/images/val

# Number of classes in the dataset.
nc: 4

# Class names, in the exact order as their class IDs (0, 1, 2, ...).
# This MUST match the order in annotator.py.
names: ['hit_circle', 'cursor', 'slider_head', 'hit_burst']
